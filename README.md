# CS 122: [Midterm Review Jeopardy Game](https://brewnetic.github.io/midterm-review-jeopardy/)

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the interactive Jeopardy game for our CS 122 midterm review! This application was created to provide a fun and engaging way for us to prepare together during our review session.

The questions and categories in this game are based directly on the official **[CS 122 Midterm Study Guide](https://github.com/Brewnetic/Midterm-Study-Guide)**. Use this game as a way to test your conceptual knowledge and identify any topics you may want to review further.

## How We'll Play in Class

We will play this game together during our scheduled midterm review session.

* **Teams:** The class will be divided into two teams.
* **Gameplay:** The active team will choose a category and a point value. I will read the "answer," and the first team to buzz in must respond in the form of a question.
* **Scoring:** Correct responses earn points, while incorrect responses deduct points. The team that answers correctly gains control of the board for the next question.

**Example of Gameplay:**

> 1.  **A team chooses:** "History for $200".
> 2.  **The host reads the clue:** "He was the first President of the United States."
> 3.  **The team buzzes in and responds:** "Who is George Washington?"
> 4.  **Result:** That is correct! The team earns 200 points and gets to choose the next question.
